Develop a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on the historical sales data.
5 datasets are given:
    train.csv — 74 millions
    test.csv —  7 millions
    sample_submission.csv — a sample submission file in the correct format
    cliente_tabla.csv — client names (can be joined with train/test on Cliente_ID)
    producto_tabla.csv — product names (can be joined with train/test on Producto_ID)
    town_state.csv — town and state (can be joined with train/test on Agencia_ID)

In this competition, you will forecast the demand of a product for a given week, at a particular store.
We have to develop a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on historical sales data. 
9 weeks of sales transaction in Mexico

Transaction->(sale,return)
Demand for a product in certain week = Sales in that week - Return in next week

The type of products they distribute to different regions are different. So, we can intuitively get an idea
that to predict the demand of a certain product in a particular store,
the region to which the store belongs to and the product's brand should be taken into consideration.


Things to note:

There may be products in the test set that don't exist in the train set.
This is the expected behavior of inventory data, since there are new products being sold all the time.
Your model should be able to accommodate this.

There are duplicate Cliente_ID's in cliente_tabla, which means one Cliente_ID may have multiple NombreCliente that are very similar.
This is due to the NombreCliente being noisy and not standardized in the raw data,
so it is up to you to decide how to clean up and use this information.

The adjusted demand (Demanda_uni_equil) is always >= 0 since demand should be either 0 or a positive value.
The reason that Venta_uni_hoy - Dev_uni_proxima sometimes has negative values is that
the returns records sometimes carry over a few weeks.


File descriptions
    train.csv — the training set
    test.csv — the test set
    sample_submission.csv — a sample submission file in the correct format
    cliente_tabla.csv — client names (can be joined with train/test on Cliente_ID)
    producto_tabla.csv — product names (can be joined with train/test on Producto_ID)
    town_state.csv — town and state (can be joined with train/test on Agencia_ID)



The main attributes in the train.csv file are:
    Semana — Week number (From Thursday to Wednesday)
    Agencia_ID — Sales Depot ID
    Canal_ID — Sales Channel ID
    Ruta_SAK — Route ID (Several routes = Sales Depot)
    Cliente_ID — Client ID
    NombreCliente — Client name
    Producto_ID — Product ID
    NombreProducto — Product Name
    Venta_uni_hoy — Sales unit this week (integer)
    Venta_hoy — Sales this week (unit: pesos)
    Dev_uni_proxima — Returns unit next week (integer)
    Dev_proxima — Returns next week (unit: pesos)
    Demanda_uni_equil — Adjusted Demand (integer) (This is the target you will predict)
